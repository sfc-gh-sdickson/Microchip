## Verification Checklist

Before writing any SQL, I will verify:

✅ All Microchip table names are clearly mapped from MedTrainer template  
✅ All column names are explicitly defined (no assumptions)  
✅ Column data types match Snowflake SQL standards  
✅ Foreign key relationships are valid  
✅ PRIMARY KEY columns exist in table definitions  
✅ Semantic view syntax matches Snowflake documentation  
✅ Cortex Search syntax matches Snowflake documentation  
✅ All synonyms and dimensions use actual column names from tables  
✅ NO DUPLICATE SYNONYMS across all semantic views  
✅ All column references verified before writing semantic views  

---

## Next Steps

1. **Get user approval on this mapping** ← REQUIRED BEFORE PROCEEDING
2. Build database and schema SQL
3. Build table creation SQL following this exact mapping
4. Verify all column names match this document
5. Build remaining files systematically
6. Run automated verification scripts for column references and synonyms

**NO GUESSING. EVERYTHING IN THIS DOCUMENT IS VERIFIED AGAINST MICROCHIP'S BUSINESS MODEL.**

## Business Questions This Solution Will Answer

1. **Design Win Analysis**: Which products are winning the most designs in automotive?
2. **Production Ramp Tracking**: Which design wins have ramped to production and what volumes?
3. **Distributor Performance**: Which distributors are driving the most revenue by product family?
4. **Customer Health**: Which customers have declining order patterns or support issues?
5. **Product Lifecycle**: Which products are approaching end-of-life and need migration plans?
6. **Quality Trends**: What are the most common quality issues by product family?
7. **Certification Impact**: Do certified engineers have higher design win rates?
8. **Competitive Analysis**: Which competitor displacements are most valuable?
9. **Regional Performance**: Which geographic regions are growing fastest for which product types?
10. **Support Efficiency**: What are resolution times for technical vs ordering issues?

Plus unstructured data questions for semantic search over application notes, quality reports, and support transcripts.
