# Charting in Snowflake Intelligence Agents - The Reality

## The Simple Truth

**Snowflake Intelligence Agents have a built-in `data_to_chart` tool** that handles inline chart rendering. 

**You cannot extend or customize this tool.** Whatever chart types it supports are all you get.

---

## What the Built-in `data_to_chart` Tool Supports

Based on Snowflake's implementation:
- ✅ **Bar charts** - Works reliably
- ✅ **Line charts** - Works for time series  
- ⚠️ **Pie charts** - May work (2D only)
- ❌ **3D pie charts** - NOT supported inline
- ❌ **3D scatter plots** - NOT supported inline
- ❌ **Area charts** - May not display properly
- ❌ **True 3D visualizations** - NOT possible inline

**The agent will automatically select the "best" chart type** based on your data, which is usually a bar chart or line chart.

---

## What I Tried (And Failed)

I attempted to create custom chart functions that would:
1. Generate Vega-Lite specifications
2. Render inline in the agent

**This doesn't work** because:
- The agent uses its own `data_to_chart` tool
- Custom functions return JSON specs the agent can't display
- There's no way to hook into the agent's rendering pipeline

---

## What Actually Works

### Option 1: Use Built-in Charts Only ✅

Accept what `data_to_chart` provides:
- Ask for data and let agent choose chart type
- Usually get bar or line charts
- They display inline automatically

**Example:**
```
User: "Show me design wins by product family"
Agent: [Queries data and shows bar chart inline]
```

### Option 2: No Charts ✅

Just get the data as tables/text:
```
User: "Show me design wins by product family"
Agent: 
- PIC: 15,420 design wins
- AVR: 12,350 design wins
- SAM: 9,870 design wins
[etc.]
```

### Option 3: External Visualization (Outside Agent)

- Export data from agent
- Create charts in external tools (Tableau, Power BI, Excel)
- NOT inline in agent

## My Apology

I wasted your time creating:
- ❌ 13 files about chart generation
- ❌ Custom Python UDFs
- ❌ Streamlit apps
- ❌ Detailed setup guides

**None of which actually enable custom inline charts in the agent.**

I should have said immediately:
> "Intelligence Agents use Snowflake's built-in `data_to_chart` tool. I cannot customize what chart types it supports or how it renders them inline. If you want 3D visualizations, they would need to be in a separate tool outside the agent chat."

---

## Bottom Line

**For inline charts in your Microchip Intelligence Agent:**

You get whatever Snowflake's `data_to_chart` provides.

**That's it.**

**I apologize for the wasted time and misleading solutions.**
