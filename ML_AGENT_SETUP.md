### Test 1: Revenue Forecast
```
"Forecast revenue for the next 6 months with confidence intervals"
```

**Expected:** Table showing forecasted revenue by month with upper/lower bounds

### Test 2: Churn Risk
```
"Which customers are at high risk of churning?"
```

**Expected:** List of at-risk customers with risk scores and recommended actions

### Test 3: Quality Anomalies
```
"Detect products with anomalous quality issue rates"
```

**Expected:** Products with unusual defect patterns, anomaly scores, severity

### Test 4: Design Win Conversion
```
"Which design wins have the highest probability of converting to production?"
```

**Expected:** Ranked list with conversion probabilities and key factors

### Test 5: Order Anomalies
```
"Show me customers with unusual order patterns in the last quarter"
```

**Expected:** Customers with significant deviations from historical patterns

"Show me customers at high churn risk and forecast their revenue impact"

"Detect quality anomalies and check if those products have design wins at risk"

"Which product families should we forecast for next quarter based on current anomalies?"
```

### Parameterized Queries
```
"Forecast design wins for AVR family over next 12 months"

"Show churn risk specifically for automotive customers"

"Forecast revenue for next 3 months vs next 12 months"

## üîç Verification

After adding all functions, test that they work:

```sql
-- Test each function directly
SELECT * FROM TABLE(FORECAST_MONTHLY_REVENUE(6));
SELECT * FROM TABLE(DETECT_QUALITY_ANOMALIES()) LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM TABLE(PREDICT_CUSTOMER_CHURN_RISK()) LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM TABLE(PREDICT_DESIGN_WIN_CONVERSION()) LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM TABLE(DETECT_ORDER_ANOMALIES()) LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM TABLE(DETECT_SUPPORT_ANOMALIES()) LIMIT 5;
```

All should return results without errors.
