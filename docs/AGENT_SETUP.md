## Step 5: Advanced Configuration (Optional)

### 5.1: Add Guardrails

In the **Instructions** section, you can add specific guardrails:
```
Never disclose proprietary product roadmaps or unreleased features.
Always cite data sources (semantic view or Cortex Search service used).
For quality issues, maintain customer confidentiality.
```

### 5.2: Configure Response Formatting

Add formatting preferences to the instructions:
```
For numerical data, use tables or bullet points.
Include time periods for trend analysis.
Highlight critical issues (quality, security) in bold.
Always include relevant product families in responses.
```

---

## Verification Steps

### Verify Semantic Views
```sql
SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS IN SCHEMA MICROCHIP_INTELLIGENCE.ANALYTICS;
-- Should show 3 semantic views
```

### Verify Cortex Search Services
```sql
SHOW CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES IN SCHEMA MICROCHIP_INTELLIGENCE.RAW;
-- Should show 3 search services
```

### Test Cortex Search Directly
```sql
SELECT PARSE_JSON(
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW(
      'MICROCHIP_INTELLIGENCE.RAW.SUPPORT_TRANSCRIPTS_SEARCH',
      '{"query": "I2C communication problems", "limit":5}'
  )
)['results'] as results;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Finding Data
1. Verify permissions on semantic views and search services
2. Check that warehouse is assigned and running
3. Ensure semantic views have data (check row counts)

### Cortex Search Not Working
1. Verify change tracking is enabled on tables
2. Check that search services are in READY state
3. Allow 5-10 minutes for initial indexing after creation

### Slow Response Times
1. Increase warehouse size for data generation
2. Verify Cortex Search indexes have built
3. Check query complexity in Cortex Analyst

---

## Next Steps

1. **Customize Questions**: Add industry-specific questions to the agent
2. **Integrate with Applications**: Use agent via API for custom applications
3. **Monitor Usage**: Track which queries are most common
4. **Expand Data**: Add more product families, customers, or time periods
5. **Enhance Search**: Add more unstructured content (emails, design reviews, etc.)

---

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** October 2025  
**Based on:** MedTrainer Intelligence Agent Template  
**Verified:** All syntax verified against Snowflake documentation

**Setup Time Estimate**: 30-45 minutes (including data generation)

---

## OPTIONAL: Add ML Models (Forecasting, Churn, Conversion)

This section is optional but adds powerful ML prediction capabilities to your agent.

### Prerequisites for ML Models

- Core setup (Steps 1-3) completed
- Files 01-06 executed successfully
- Agent configured with semantic views and Cortex Search

### ML Setup Overview

1. Upload and run Snowflake Notebook to train models
2. Execute SQL wrapper functions file
3. Add 3 ML procedures to agent as tools

**Time:** 20-30 minutes

---

### ML Step 1: Upload Notebook to Snowflake (5 min)

1. In Snowsight, click **Projects** → **Notebooks**
2. Click **+ Notebook** → **Import .ipynb file**
3. Upload: `notebooks/microchip_ml_models.ipynb`
4. Name it: `Microchip ML Models`
5. Configure:
   - **Database:** MICROCHIP_INTELLIGENCE
   - **Schema:** ANALYTICS
   - **Warehouse:** MICROCHIP_WH
6. Click **Create**

### ML Step 2: Add Required Packages

1. In the notebook, click **Packages** dropdown (upper right)
2. Search and add each package:
   - `snowflake-ml-python`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `xgboost`
   - `matplotlib`
3. Click **Start** to activate the notebook

### ML Step 3: Run Notebook to Train Models (10 min)

1. Click **Run All** (or run each cell sequentially)
2. Wait for training to complete (2-3 minutes per model)
3. Verify output shows:
   - "✅ Revenue forecasting model trained"
   - "✅ Churn classification model trained"
   - "✅ Design win conversion model trained"
   - "✅ Revenue model registered to Model Registry as REVENUE_PREDICTOR"
   - "✅ Churn model registered to Model Registry as CHURN_PREDICTOR"
   - "✅ Conversion model registered to Model Registry as CONVERSION_PREDICTOR"

**Models created:**
- REVENUE_PREDICTOR (Linear Regression for revenue forecasting)
- CHURN_PREDICTOR (Random Forest for churn classification)
- CONVERSION_PREDICTOR (Logistic Regression for conversion prediction)

### ML Step 4: Create Wrapper Procedures (2 min)

Execute the SQL wrapper functions:

```sql
@sql/ml/07_create_model_wrapper_functions.sql
```

This creates 3 stored procedures that wrap the Model Registry models so the agent can call them.

**Procedures created:**
- PREDICT_REVENUE(months_ahead)
- PREDICT_CUSTOMER_CHURN(segment_filter)
- PREDICT_DESIGN_WIN_CONVERSION(product_family_filter)

### ML Step 5: Add ML Procedures to Agent (10 min)

   - Find designs likely to go to production
   - Prioritize design wins
   
   Parameter:
   - product_family_filter: Filter by family (PIC, AVR, SAM, dsPIC, FPGA, etc.)
     or empty string for all families
   
   Returns: JSON with conversion count and conversion rate percentage
   
   Example: "Which PIC family design wins will likely convert to production?"
