# Chart Integration Fix - Making 3D Charts Actually Display

## The Problem

The agent generates Plotly chart specifications (JSON) but cannot directly render them in the chat interface. This is because:
1. Snowflake Intelligence Agents can't execute Plotly rendering code
2. The agent can only return text or invoke external tools
3. Chart specifications need to be passed to Streamlit for actual rendering

## The Solution

Use Streamlit as a **linked tool** that the agent opens when charts are requested. Here's the corrected approach:

---

## Updated Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Deploy the Optimized Streamlit App

1. In Snowsight, go to **Streamlit** → **+ Streamlit App**
2. Create new app:
   - **Name**: `MICROCHIP_CHART_GENERATOR`
   - **Database**: `MICROCHIP_INTELLIGENCE`
   - **Schema**: `ANALYTICS`
   - **Warehouse**: `MICROCHIP_WH`

3. **Replace ALL code** with `streamlit/chart_app_v2.py`

4. Click **Run** to deploy

### Step 2: Configure Agent to Open Streamlit App

When adding the Streamlit tool to your agent, update the description to make it clear this opens a new interface:

```
CHART GENERATION TOOL

When users request visualizations (pie charts, 3D charts, scatter plots, etc.),
use this tool to open the interactive chart generator.

The tool will:
1. Open the Streamlit app in a new window/tab
2. Allow the user to execute their query
3. Select the chart type (including 3D pie charts)
4. Generate and display the interactive visualization

Usage pattern:
User: "Show me design wins in a 3D pie chart"
Agent: I'll open the chart generator for you. Please:
       1. Copy this query: [provides SQL]
       2. Paste into the app
       3. Select "3D Pie Chart"
       4. Click Generate

The Streamlit app supports:
- 3D Pie Charts (with pull effects)
- 3D Scatter Plots (interactive rotation)
- All standard chart types (bar, line, scatter, area, etc.)
```

### Step 3: Update Agent Instructions

Add this to your agent's Response Instructions:

```
For chart requests:
1. Generate the appropriate SQL query using semantic views
2. Invoke the MICROCHIP_CHART_GENERATOR Streamlit tool
3. Provide the user with:
   - The SQL query to paste
   - The chart type to select
   - Any specific column selections needed
4. Tell the user the Streamlit app will open where they can see the actual 3D visualization

Example:
User: "Show me design wins by product family in a 3D pie chart"

Agent response:
"I'll help you create that 3D pie chart! Opening the chart generator...

Please use this query in the app:
```sql
SELECT product_family, COUNT(*) as design_wins
FROM MICROCHIP_INTELLIGENCE.RAW.DESIGN_WINS
GROUP BY product_family
ORDER BY design_wins DESC
```

In the app:
1. Paste the query above
2. Click 'Execute Query'  
3. Select '3D Pie Chart'
4. Click 'Generate Chart'

You'll see an interactive 3D pie chart with pull effects that you can explore!"
```

## Alternative: Simpler Direct Link Approach

If the above doesn't work perfectly, use this simplified pattern:

### Agent Response Template

```
To view your data as a 3D pie chart:

1. Click this link: [Streamlit App URL]
2. The app will open with your data
3. Select "3D Pie Chart" from the dropdown
4. Click "Generate Chart"

Your data shows:
- PIC Family: 15,420 design wins (35%)
- AVR Family: 12,350 design wins (28%)
- SAM Family: 9,870 design wins (22%)
[etc.]

The 3D visualization will show these proportions with visual depth and pull effects.
```

## How to Get Streamlit App URL

1. Open your deployed Streamlit app in Snowsight
2. Copy the URL from browser (looks like: `https://app.snowflake.com/[region]/[account]/#/streamlit-apps/...`)
3. Add this URL to your agent's instructions as a reference

---

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Request 3D Pie Chart

**User:** "Show me design wins by product family in a 3D pie chart"

**Expected Agent Behavior:**
1. Opens Streamlit app automatically (OR provides link)
2. Shows the SQL query to use
3. Instructs user to select "3D Pie Chart"
4. User sees actual interactive 3D pie chart with pull effects

### Test 2: Request 3D Scatter

**User:** "Create a 3D scatter plot of product price, flash size, and RAM"

**Expected Agent Behavior:**
1. Opens Streamlit app
2. Provides query for product specifications
3. User selects columns for X, Y, Z axes
4. User sees rotatable 3D scatter plot

---

## Why This Approach Works

### The Agent's Role:
✅ Understands user's chart request  
✅ Generates appropriate SQL query  
✅ Opens Streamlit tool  
✅ Guides user through the process

### Streamlit's Role:
✅ Executes the SQL query  
✅ Renders actual Plotly 3D charts  
✅ Provides interactive visualization  
✅ All rendering happens in Snowflake

### User Experience:
1. Ask agent for chart
2. Agent opens Streamlit app
3. Follow simple steps
4. **See actual 3D chart!**

---

## Verification Commands

Test the Streamlit app directly:

```sql
-- Open Streamlit app manually
-- Navigate to: Streamlit → MICROCHIP_CHART_GENERATOR

-- Test query:
SELECT 
    product_family,
    COUNT(*) as design_wins
FROM MICROCHIP_INTELLIGENCE.RAW.DESIGN_WINS
GROUP BY product_family
ORDER BY design_wins DESC;

-- Select: "3D Pie Chart"
-- Click: "Generate Chart"
-- Result: You should see an interactive 3D pie chart!
```

---

## What You Should See

### 3D Pie Chart Features:
- ✅ Slices pulled out for 3D effect
- ✅ Donut hole in center
- ✅ Percentage labels
- ✅ Hover for details
- ✅ Legend on the side
- ✅ Color-coded slices

### 3D Scatter Plot Features:
- ✅ Three axes (X, Y, Z)
- ✅ Interactive rotation with mouse
- ✅ Color gradient by value
- ✅ Zoom and pan
- ✅ Hover for coordinates

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Agent generates specs but I don't see charts"

**Root Cause:** Agent can't render Plotly in chat interface

**Solution:** Streamlit app must open separately to show actual visualization

**Fix:** Update agent instructions to explicitly say "opening chart generator" and provide link

### Issue: "Streamlit app shows but chart doesn't render"

**Root Cause:** Missing data or incorrect column selection

**Solution:** 
1. Verify query returns data (check preview)
2. Ensure columns selected match query output
3. For 3D charts, need appropriate number of columns

### Issue: "Chart type defaults to bar instead of 3D pie"

**Root Cause:** User didn't select chart type in app

**Solution:**
1. After query executes, manually select "3D Pie Chart" from dropdown
2. Then click "Generate Chart"

## Expected User Flow

```
User: "Show me design wins in a 3D pie chart"
    ↓
Agent: Recognizes chart request
    ↓
Agent: Generates SQL query from semantic view
    ↓
Agent: Opens MICROCHIP_CHART_GENERATOR Streamlit app
    ↓
Agent: Provides instructions to user
    ↓
User: Follows steps in Streamlit app
    ↓
User: Sees actual interactive 3D pie chart! ✅
```

## Quick Reference

### What Agent CAN Do:
✅ Generate SQL queries  
✅ Open Streamlit app  
✅ Provide instructions  
✅ Suggest chart types

### What Agent CANNOT Do:
❌ Render Plotly charts in chat  
❌ Display 3D visualizations inline  
❌ Execute Streamlit code directly

### What Streamlit App DOES:
✅ Executes SQL queries  
✅ Renders actual Plotly charts  
✅ Displays 3D visualizations  
✅ Provides interactivity

---

## Summary

The chart tool **WORKS** but requires this flow:
1. User requests chart from agent
2. Agent opens Streamlit app
3. User completes chart generation in Streamlit
4. User sees actual 3D visualization

**The 3D charts ARE available - they just display in the Streamlit app, not in the agent chat.**
